      <p>
        My name is Cat Vu, or Kate. I was born and raised in Vietnam, Iâ€™m
        currently studying Computer Science at the San Francisco State
        University. I started web design and development about one year ago and
        have been enjoying working and developing my skill in both art and
        science aspects. I hope to get myself into exploring the frontend
        industry even more in future. If you want to know more about me, click
