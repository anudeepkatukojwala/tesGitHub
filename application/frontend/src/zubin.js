      <p>
        I am Zubin Kanga. A transfer student at sfsu for 1.5 years now. While
        I'm currently a full time student I'm looking to become employed full
        time in the immediate future and transition to part time school. When
        I'm not working on software I enjoy exercising, playing with my dog, and
        repairing/building pc's.
